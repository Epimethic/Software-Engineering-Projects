Python Projects - These are some python programs I have taught myself whilst learning to code.

I am teaching myself how to code and these are the programs that I have created so far.

courier.py calculates the shipping cost of sending a parcel overseas. It asks: the user how far the parcel needs to travel in km; if they want to send by sea or air; 
and if they want full insurance. It then produces a final cost.

task_manager.py is a program that registers and stores usernames and passwords onto a system and lets each user add a new task, view all tasks and view their own tasks.
The admin has extra features where they can register new users and see relevant statistics based on the total amount of tasks and users.
The program stores all information in a txt file and displays the information clearly in the IDE.
